### Associate Software Development Engineer - Clover Bay Technologies

- June 2022 â€“ Present
- Bengaluru, India

At Clover Bay Technologies, I've been working on the development innovative e-commerce platform. I've been involved in designing and implementing microservices, asynchronous APIs, and Kafka consumers using technologies like Reactive Spring Boot, Couchbase, Kafka, and Redis.

As a Machine Learning Intern at Highradius Corporation, I worked on developing a payment prediction model using various algorithms like random forest and XGBoost. The model aimed to improve cash flow management by accurately forecasting payment dates. I utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### Ecommerce Microservices

- March 2023

In this project, I developed a real-time microservices application using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Netflix Eureka, API Gateway, Keycloak, Resilience4j, and Kafka. The application leverages service discovery with Eureka, efficient routing with the API Gateway, and secure authentication and authorization with Keycloak.

### AI ENABLED B2B INVOICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

- August 2021

I developed an AI-enabled B2B invoice management system using Java Servlet, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery. This system utilized regression models for data prediction, achieving an impressive mean squared error (MSE) of 10. The user interface features pagination, editable fields, and grid row manipulation.

### RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

- May 2020

For movie enthusiasts, I developed a recommendation system using Python and the sci-kit-learn library. The system suggests new movies based on their similarity to a user's favorite films. The recommendation engine scraped data from IMDB and utilized cosine similarity for movie score calculation. I also implemented a user-friendly GUI for an interactive experience.
